    <h3>Favicon Design Process</h3>
    <p>I created my Favicon in a 32x32 pixel canvas. I included a black outline to define the Favicon to make it stand out. I colored it with dark red, yellow, golden yellow, and light blue. My Favicon is inspired by the medieval shields used by the Arabs. </p>
    <img src="Favicon.png" alt="A PNG of my Favicon" height="300"> <!--I included an image tag for my Favicon-->

    <h3>Webpage Building Process</h3>
    <p>To create my webpage, I started off with the "!DOCTYPE html" followed by the "html" and "head" tags. In the metadata, I learned a new tag called the "link" tag, which allowed me to input my Favicon into the Website. I created my headings with the required inform with the "h1-h6" tags.</p>
